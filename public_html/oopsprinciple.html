        <h5>What is Object-Oriented Programing?</h5>
            The term <b>“Object-Oriented Programming” (OOP)</b> was coined by Alan Kay around 1966 while he was at grad
            school. The language called Simula was the first programming language with the features of
            Object-oriented programming. It was developed in 1967 for making simulation programs, in which
            the most important information was called objects. OOPs has been adapted by various programming
            languages including Python Today its application is in almost every field such as Real-time systems,
            Artificial intelligence, and expert systems, Client-server systems, Object-oriented databases, and
            many more. The goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to create "objects." An object is a collection of
        variables and functions that are linked together. These variables are frequently referred to as object
        attributes, and functions are referred to as object behavior. These items provide the software a more
        organized and logical structure.<br>
        <img src="images/img.png" style="height: 300px;width: 700px;align-content: center;padding-left: 20%">
        </p>
        <p style="padding-right: 60px;padding-top: 2px;">
        <br>For example, a car is an object. If we consider the car as an object, its properties include its color,
        model, price, and brand, among others. Acceleration, slowing down, and changing gears would be its
        behavior/function. Object-Oriented programming is famous because it implements the real-world entities
        like objects, hiding, inheritance, etc in programming. It makes visualization easier because it is close
        to real-world scenarios. Major OOP (object-oriented programming) concepts in Python include Class, Object, Method, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Data Abstraction, and Encapsulation. Let’s learn about each one of them with examples.
        </p>
            <h6>Classes & Objects:</h6>
        <p style="padding-right: 70px;padding-top: 2px;">
            A class is a collection of objects.  Unlike the primitive data structures, classes are data
            structures that the user defines. They make the code more manageable. In python, we declare a class
            with the keyword "class" followed by class name and semicolon. Only the object's description or
            blueprint is created when we define a class. There will be no memory allocation until the object
            is created. Real data or information is stored in the objector instance. The term "instantiation"
            refers to the process of producing a new object or instance of a class. Let's see a calculator class as example:
        </p>  <pre><code>
        """ This is the calculator program"""
        from calc.historyMod.history import History

        class Calculator:
             """ This is the Calculator class"""

        history = []

         @staticmethod
        def add_number(tuple_values: tuple):
        """ adds number to result"""
        # create an addition object using the factory we created on the calculation class
        History.add_addition_calculation(tuple_values)
        return True

        @staticmethod
        def subtract_number(tuple_values: tuple):
        """ subtract number from result"""
        History.add_subtraction_calculation(tuple_values)
        return True
    </code></pre>
        <p style="padding-right: 60px;padding-top: 2px;">
        Here we could see a class with different methods on it. Methods are the functions that we used to
        describe the behavior of the objects. Now, there are four fundamental concepts of Object-oriented
        programming – <b>Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data abstraction.</b> We will have a look
        how these principles are depicted in calculator class.
</p>
        <h6>Encapsulation</h6>
        <p style="padding-right: 80px;padding-top: 2px;">
     In the above calculator code we could see that an object of History class is used to get the historical data.
     After the addition or subtraction operation the values are sent to the History class by using the methods in
    the History class using history object. Encapsulation is a way to ensure security. Basically, it hides the
    data from the access of outsiders. In the above program we have provided all variables as public, so that it will
    be available everywhere outside the class, if they imported the History class. If we need to actually
     prevent the access of attributes/methods from outside the scope of a class, you can use “private members“.
    In order to declare the attributes/method as private members, use double underscore ( __ ) in the prefix.
    Such as – self.__name or def __method(); If we declare the variables and methods as protected, then the
    attribute and method are protected and should not be used outside the access of the class and sub-classes
    but can be accessed by class methods and objects. In our Calculator project we use encapsulation
    in all of our classes. For example, our Calculator class encapsulates the add, subtract, multiply and
    divide methods. There are getter and setter methods that can be used to get and set any private attributes
    respectively if it is required to change the private attributes as part of the business requirement.
    This allows us to keep a track of who is changing/setting the private attribute newly further allowing us
    to backtrack and resolve issues, if any. In the example given, we have used a getter method which will get
            the actual attribute’s value from the protected attribute.</p>
            <pre><code>
    class Calculation:
    """Calculation class"""

    def __init__(self, values: tuple):
        """ constructor method"""
        self.values = Calculation.convert_args_to_tuple_of_float(values)

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, values: tuple):
        """ factory method"""
        return cls(values)

    @staticmethod
    def convert_args_to_tuple_of_float(values):
        """ standardize values to list of floats"""
        list_values_float = []
        for item in values:
            list_values_float.append(float(item))
        return tuple(list_values_float)
    </code></pre>
     <h6>Inheritance</h6>
     <p style="padding-right: 90px;padding-top: 2px;">
         Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.
         The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as Parent class. The class that inherits the
         properties from the parent class is the Child class. Along with the inherited properties and methods, a child
         class can have its own properties and methods.<br>
         Different types of Inheritance are as follows:<br>

         <b>Single inheritance</b>: Single level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a
         single parent class.<br>
         <b>Multilevel Inheritance </b>: Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an
         immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from its parent class (in a manner like,
         child→parent→grandparent). <br>
         <b>Hierarchical Inheritance</b>: Hierarchical level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit
         properties from a parent class.<br>
         <b>Multiple Inheritance</b>: Multiple level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from
         more than one base class.<br>
         <img src="images/Types-of-Inheritance.jpeg" style="height: 400px;width: 800px;align-content: center;padding-left: 10%">
         <br>
         We can have a look into the Addition class as an example of
         Inheritance. Calculation is the base class of addition which is extended by Addition.
         <pre>
        <code>
        from calc.calculation.calculation import Calculation
        class Addition(Calculation):
        """Addition class"""

        def get_result(self):
        """ addition """
        total_sum = 0.0
        for value in self.values:
            total_sum += value
        return total_sum
        </code>
    </pre>
        <p style="padding-right: 90px;padding-top: 2px;">
        On extending the calculation class all the methods in it will be accessible for the Addition class. In our Calculator
        project we have a parent class Calculation that has a tuple “values” and a method to convert “values” to a list of
        floats. We then have Addition, Subtraction, Multiply and Divide classes that inherit Calculation so that they can use
        Calculation's members. After inheriting from the Calculation, the children only need to implement a “get_result”
        function, which needs to be different for each of the operations performed by the children.
</p>
    <h6>Polymorphism</h6>
        <p style="padding-right: 100px;padding-top: 2px;">
            Polymorphism means having many forms. In OOP it refers to the functions having the same names but
            carrying different functionalities. One example of this is python's “print” method. For example,
            the print method has custom implementations for integers, strings, lists. You don't need to be
            concerned with letting the function know what type of data is being printed.<br>
            <img src="images/Polymorphism.png" style="height: 300px;width: 600px;align-content: center;padding-left: 10%">
            <br>The base class ‘Calculation’ defines a method skeleton for get_result() which the child classes
            inherit and re-defines them according to their requirement. The ‘Multiplication’ and "Division'
            classes redefines it to multiply and divide all the numbers it receives in a list and returns the
            result of the numbers. In the same manner, all the other child classes inherit the properties of
            base class and molds/re-defines the get_result() method to satisfy their requirements. For
            polymorphism to occur, there has to be inheritance between classes.
        </p>
        <h6>Abstraction</h6>
        <p style="padding-right: 110px;padding-top: 2px;">
            We use Abstraction for hiding the internal details or implementations of a function and showing
            its functionalities only. This is similar to the way you know how to drive a car without knowing
            the background mechanism. Any class with at least one abstract function is an abstract class.
            In order to create an abstraction class first, you need to import ABC class from abc module. This
            lets you create abstract methods inside it. ABC stands for Abstract Base Class.
            We cannot create an object for the abstract class with the abstract method. Abstraction can be
            done via Inheritance only.<br>
            <img src="images/abs.jpeg" style="height: 300px;width: 600px;align-content: center;padding-left: 5%">
            <br>
            In our Calculator project, we can instantiate an Addition object, pass it the list of values, do
            the calculation and get the result by writing the following code.
            <pre><code>
            from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
            class Calculation(ABC):
            """ calculation abstract base class"""
            def __init__(self,values: tuple):
        """ constructor method"""
            self._values = Calculation.convert_args_to_list_float(values)

            class Addition(Calculation):
            """ calculation addition class"""
            def get_result(self):
            """returns the addition result"""
            return sum(self.values)
    </code></pre>
        In above case, definitions are hidden from the user. The Abstract method is just providing a
        declaration. The child classes need to provide the definition.
