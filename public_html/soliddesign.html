            A good algorithm is the foundation of a good software application. After the algorithm is in place,
            the next most critical step in Software Engineering is to verify that the software or application is
            created according to best design and architecture practices. Various best practices for effective
            software application design have been identified by several researchers and experts. The design
            principles known by the term SOLID are one of the most well-known. These best practices, when
            considered in designing an object-oriented software application would tend to reduce code complexity,
            reduce the risk of code breaks, improve the communication between different entities and make code
            more flexible, readable, and manageable.

        <p style="padding-right: 80px;padding-top: 10px;">
            Robert C Martin's SOLID principles are as below:<br>

        <h6>S – Single Responsibility Principle:</h6><br>
        The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one primary responsibility
        and should not take other responsibilities. Robert C. Martin explains this as “A class should have
        only one reason to change”. In our below Calculator class example, each class has its own single
        responsibility like the calculator class has a single responsibility of being the outermost class
        that holds methods for all operations, like the ‘add_addition_calculation’, ‘add_subtraction_calculation’, each having a single responsibility
        of calling the respective operations’ classes, such as ‘Addition’, ‘Subtraction’, ‘Multiplication’ and ‘Division’ respectively. These classes in-turn have a single responsibility of performing their respective operations on a list of numbers.
        <pre><code>
    from calc.historyMod.history import History


    class Calculator:
    """ This is the Calculator class"""

    history = []

    @staticmethod
    def add_number(tuple_values: tuple):
        """ adds number to result"""
        # create an addition object using the factory we created on the calculation class
        History.add_addition_calculation(tuple_values)
        return True

    @staticmethod
    def subtract_number(tuple_values: tuple):
        """ subtract number from result"""
        History.add_subtraction_calculation(tuple_values)
        return True
        </code></pre>
        The Single Responsibility Principle asks us not to add additional responsibilities to a class so that
        we don’t have to modify a class unless there is a change to its primary responsibility.<br></p>

        <h6>O – Open-Closed Principle: </h6><br>
        <p style="padding-right: 90px;padding-top: -1px;">
            Open Closed Principle was first conceptualized by Berterd Meyer in 1988. Robert C. Martin mentioned
            this as “the most important principle of object-oriented design”. Open Closed Principle states that
            “Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for
            modification.” Following this principle ensures that a class is well defined to do what it is
            supposed to do. Adding any further features can be done by creating new entities that extend the
            existing class’s features and add more features to itself. Thus preventing frequent and trivial
            changes to a well-established low-level class.
            <br>
            We would like to describe this based on calculator example. At first, we had a calculator program
            which just do the normal calculations. Then we thought to add a functionality which stores these
            calculations in memory. So we created a new class History.</p>
            <pre>
        <code>
            """history"""
    from calc.calculation.addition import Addition
    from calc.calculation.division import Division
    from calc.calculation.multiplication import Multiplication
    from calc.calculation.subtraction import Subtraction


    class History:
    """ This is the History class"""

    history = []

    @staticmethod
    def get_result_of_first_calculation_added_to_history():
        """Adding the first result to the history array"""
        return History.history[0].get_result()

    @staticmethod
    def clear_history():
        """Clear history"""
        History.history.clear()
        return True

    @staticmethod
    def history_count():
        """Get the count of history History stored"""
        return len(History.history)

    @staticmethod
    def add_calculation_to_history(calculation):
        """Adding the results to the history array"""
        History.history.append(calculation)
        return True
        </code>
    </pre>
        By doing this we have now removed the previous constraints that required modification to the base class.
<br><br>
          <h6>  L – Liskov Substitution Principle:</h6><br>
        <p style="padding-right: 100px;padding-top: -1px;">
            Liskov Substitution Principle states that "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances
            of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." Liskov Substitution Principle
            was introduced by Barbara Liskov through a subtyping relation called Strong Behavioral Subtyping.
            This principle states that if a class Sub is a subtype of a class Sup, then in the program, objects
            of type Sup should be easily substituted with objects of type Sub without needing to change the
            program. Uncle Bob included this as one of the top 5 SOLID Design Principles definition.<br>
            In this case, "substitution" means that a parent class should be able to be substituted with the
            child class. In order to do this, the parameters that the parent class requires should be compatible
            with the parameters required by all the child classes. In our Calculator project the parent class,
            Calculation, requires a list of tuples. If one of the Calculation child classes, for example the
            Addition class requires hex numbers as input and the Subtraction class requires floats, that makes
            the input requirements incompatible with the base class.<br></p>
        <h6> I – Interface Segregation Principle:</h6><br>
        <p style="padding-right: 110px;padding-top: -1px;">
            "No client should be compelled to rely on methods it does not use," according to the Interface
            Segregation Principle. While consulting for Xerox, Robert C Martin proposed the Interface Segregation
            Principle. Instead of a single interface with several functions, the Interface Segregation Principle
            recommends constructing smaller interfaces known as "role interfaces." Clients would only rely on
            the methods that are relevant to them if the role-based methods were separated into smaller role
            interfaces.<br>
            As an example consider ‘Calculation’ and a child class ‘Addition’. If in the parent class, the
            method ‘convert_args_to_list_float()’ have not been a static method, its child class(s) would have
            had to implement that method unnecessarily and repeatedly and hence does not conform to ISP principle
            . Thus, the method is made a static method which gives freedom for the child class.<br></p>
        <p style="padding-right: 110px;padding-top: 1px;">
        <h6>D – Dependency Inversion Principle:</h6><br>
        According to the Dependency Inversion Principle:<br>

        a) Low-level modules should not rely on high-level modules. Abstractions should be used in both cases.<br>

        b) Abstractions should not be based on specifics. Abstractions should determine the details.<br></p>
        <p style="padding-right: 120px;padding-top: 1px;">
        If your code adheres to the Open-Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle, it will also
        be compliant with the Dependency Inversion Principle. You can construct Interfaces that can be used
        to give various high-level implementations by following the Open-Closed Principle. By adopting the
        Liskov Substitution Principle, you can assure that low-level class objects can be replaced with
        high-level class objects without causing the application to break. As a result, adhering to these
        two principles ensures that both high-level and low-level classes rely on interfaces. As a result,
        you'd be following the Dependency Inversion Principle implicitly. <br>
        As an example consider ‘Calculation’ and a child class ‘Addition’. The parent class, ‘Calculation’ is not
            dependent on the child class, but rather it depends on the abstract implementation of the
            ‘get_result()’ method. The parent class also is not dependent on how this method has been implemented
            in its child class(s). The child class follows abstraction by defining this method in its own unique
            way by expecting its own object and returning a final result.
